# 🚌 Ulusoy Turizm - Bus Ticketing & Fleet Management System

A comprehensive, **Full-Stack** web application designed to handle the digital operations of a modern bus company, including Ticket Sales, Route Management, Real-time Vehicle Tracking, and an advanced Admin Dashboard.

2.  **Admin Panel:** A powerful dashboard for company staff to manage routes, buses, pricing matrices, and agents.
3.  **Backend (API):** A robust RESTful API service built with NestJS and PostgreSQL to manage data flow and business logic.
